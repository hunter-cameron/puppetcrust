This directory holds scripts to be used for interacting with PICRUSt using my dynamic database system.

In this system, users can select as many or as few genomes as they want to use as a custom PICRUSt database.

Samples of marker a FASTA files and a trait table to be used with the create_picrust_database.py script can be found in the samples/ directory.
